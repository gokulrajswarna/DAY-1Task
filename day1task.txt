Object and internal Representation in Javascript:

 Object in Javascript is most important data type and forms the building
 blocks for modern Javascript. 
 
 These objects are quite different from Javascript is primitive data types
 (EX)(Number,string,Boolean,null,undefind)
 
 In the sense that while these primitive data types all store a single value each
 
 Variable that are assigned a reference value are given pointer that value

OBJECTS AND PROPERTIES:

  A Javascript object has properties associated with it.
  
  A properties of object can be explained as a variable that is attached to the object
  
  object properties are basically the same as ordinary javascript variables.
  
  you access the properties as an object with a simple dot.otation
      
       Object name.property Name
     
   
 CREATE JAVASCRIPT OBJECT WITH OBJECT LITERAL

    One of easiest way to create a jaascript object is object literal

(EX)
    let bike={name:'Hondaunicon',maker:"Honda",engine:'180cc'}

JAVASCRIPT CONSTRUCTOR

   Constructor is nothing but a function and with help of new keyword
   
   function variables(name,maker){
   this.name=name;
   this.maker=maker;
}
  let car1=new vechile('swift' 'maruthi')
  let car2=new vechile('kwid'  'renault')
   
    console.log (car1.name); // outout:swift
    console.log (car2.name); // output:kwid
